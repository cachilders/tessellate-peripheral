tessellate-peripheral is a new project with an undetermined course. At its heart, however, it is a growing POC of multi-platform IoT ports of a simple http post service. All it does at present is post pings to the [tessellate-core](https://github.com/cachilders/tessellate-core) service. The very limited results can be seen on the [temporary home of the current Tessellate frontend](http://tessellate.cc).

It will grow.

Ports are separated by branch. Current software platforms are vanilla JS, a Tessel 2 flavor of JS, Lua for ESP8266, Arduino for ESP8266 and MXChip, Windows 10 IoT, Python, C++/Spark for Particle, Golang, and Squirrel for Electric Imp.
